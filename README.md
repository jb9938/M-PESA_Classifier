# M-PESA_Classifier

# Topic
“Mobile money (m-money) refers to the use of mobile phones to perform financial and banking
functions.” (IFC Mobile Money Study 2011: Summary Report).
In low-income countries, mobile money is a substitute for banking access. In fact, individuals
do not need a bank account to perform financial transactions (send and receive money) via
their mobile service. One of its biggest advantages is that it can reach the most remote and
vulnerable populations. Many observers agree that this new financial tool has an important
role in widening financial inclusion in low-income countries (See Jack and Suri 2011 and Suri
2017 for a review).
Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mobile money users and non-users characteristics.
In this application, we want to analyze the determinants of mobile money adoption using (real)
data from a survey of 2,282 households in Kenya on M-PESA (“M” for Mobile and “Pesa” for
Money in Swahili), one of the most successful mobile money applications. 

We will attempt to evaluate these determinants using sets of classifiers (Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest and KNN) and compare their performances.
